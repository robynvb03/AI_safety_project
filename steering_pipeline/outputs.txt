Hello my name is Sidney Sands. I'm Justin Laslow of Nashville, TN. After a long training session I was ready to get into making my way on the track. I took first step and started to craft my sound making kit.  I've always been a cool dude to be around, I have a dream job to do, and a fascinating world to live in. So, I thought I'd show up this weekend to update the blog and build something that would let me distinctly feel like I belong.
Hello my name is Max. I'm here in my hometown of Portland, OR, hiking. I have been trekking most of my life, searching for ever. I've had a lot of adventures since I was young up until about 2 years ago. Hoping that people would be able to help. I'm a 2 year-old thru-hiker and I've always wanted to make some money. Thanks so much. I love hiking, accepting donations, Polish and even traveling with my beautiful wife.
